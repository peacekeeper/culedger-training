# After the app name line comes all the address book lines, 
# which give the addresses of all members, which is used by the simulation.
# If the sim is run from a .jar file, put this file in the same directory as the jar.
# If the sim is run in eclipse, put this file in the  sdk/  directory.
#
# Then list one member per line. For each member, list these, separated by commas:
#         nickname            - a single-letter abbreviation for the member's name
#         fullname            - the member's name
#         internal port       - in range 0-65535
#         internal IP address - four numbers, each in the range 0-255, separated by dots
#         external port       - in range 0-65535
#         external IP address - four numbers, each in the range 0-255, separated by dots
#
# The “internal” (or local or private) address is how the member computer is reached by other
# computers on the same local network, with no Network Address Translation (NAT) in between.
#
# The “external” (or public) address is how it is reached by outside computers. It will often 
# be the address of the router that does the NATing.
#
# Lines starting with # are comments.
# Blank lines are ignored.
# Whitespace is ignored (except line breaks).
# The nicknames and names must not contain any commas.
